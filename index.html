		    I'm an applied statistics and machine learning researcher with
		    experience working on problems related to the microbiome and
		    cybersecurity. I spend most of my time learning how to better explore,
		    model, and learn from data. I think that sharing reproducible workflows
		    and accessible distillations is as important as making discoveries and
		    proposing algorithms. My ideal statistician is an insightful scientist,
		    as well as a skilled technician. I occasionally post notes to my <a
		    href="http://krisrs1128.github.io/info-uncertainty/">blog</a>. Many of
		    my projects are public on <a

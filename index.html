        I'm currently a machine learning researcher working at
        <a href="https://www.obsidiansecurity.com/"> Obsidian Security</a>. I
        recently completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford University, advised by
        <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan Holmes</a>.
        My thesis was on <i><a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12375828">Discovery
        and Visualization of Latent Structure with Applications to the Microbiome</a></i>.
        I was previously a <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellow
        and helped organize projects with <a href="https://stats-for-good.stanford.edu/">Statistics
        for Social Good</a> and <a href="https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-sf"> DataKind SF</a>

        I spend most of my time learning how to better explore,
		    model, and learn from data. I think that sharing reproducible workflows
		    and accessible distillations is as important as making discoveries and
		    proposing algorithms. My ideal statistician is an insightful scientist,
		    as well as a skilled technician. I occasionally post notes to my <a
		    href="http://krisrs1128.github.io/info-uncertainty/">blog</a>. Many of
		    my projects are public on <a
		    href="http://github.com/krisrs1128">github</a>. </p>

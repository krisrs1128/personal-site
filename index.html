              I'm currently a postdoc at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a>, working in
              <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/">Yoshua Bengio</a>'s lab
              on problems related to Humanitarian AI. I completed my PhD in Statistics at
              Stanford University, advised by
              <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan Holmes</a>.
              My thesis was on <i><a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12375828">Discovery and
                  Visualization of Latent Structure with Applications to the Microbiome</a></i>. I
              previously worked at <a href="https://www.obsidiansecurity.com/">Obsidian
                  Security</a>, applying machine learning to problems in cybersecurity. I was a
              2016 <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/">Data Science for Social Good</a>
              fellow and helped organize projects with
              <a href="https://stats-for-good.stanford.edu/">Statistics for Social Good</a> and
              <a href="https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-sf"> DataKind SF</a>.

              I'm most interested in questions at the interface of statistics
              (reasoning about uncertainty) and machine learning (deploying real-world
              systems), especially those that would enable applications in
              heterogeneous, resource-constrained settings. I think that sharing
              reproducible workflows and accessible distillations is as important as
              making discoveries and proposing algorithms. My ideal researcher
              is an insightful scientist, as well as a skilled technician. I
              occasionally post notes to my <a
              href="http://krisrs1128.github.io/info-uncertainty/">blog</a>.
              Many of my projects are public on <a
              href="http://github.com/krisrs1128">github</a>.

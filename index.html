              I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the <a
              href="https://stat.wisc.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at UW
              Madison. I study statistical techniques for discovery,
              dimensionality reduction, and visual interaction in complex data,
              with a focus on climate change and the microbiome. I was
              previously a postdoc in humanitarian AI at <a
              href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila</a> in Montreal, in Yoshua
              Bengio's group. I completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford
              University, advised by <a
              href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan
              Holmes</a>. My thesis was on <i><a
              href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12375828">Discovery
              and Visualization of Latent Structure with Applications to the
              Microbiome</a></i>.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I seek out simple strategies for making progress on real-world
              problems. I think that sharing reproducible workflows and
              accessible distillations is as important as making discoveries and
              proposing algorithms. My ideal researcher is an insightful
              scientist, as well as a skilled technician. I occasionally post
              notes to my <a
              href="http://krisrs1128.github.io/info-uncertainty/">blog</a>.
              Many of my projects are public on <a
              href="http://github.com/krisrs1128">github</a>.

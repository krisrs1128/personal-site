		    I'm currently a fifth year PhD student in the <a
		    href="http://statweb.stanford.edu">Stanford Statistics Department</a>,
		    advised by <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/">Professor Susan
		    Holmes</a>. I spend most of my time learning how to better explore,
		    model, and learn from data. I think that sharing reproducible workflows
		    and accessible distillations is as important as making discoveries and
		    proposing algorithms. My ideal statistician is an insightful scientist,
		    as well as a skilled technician. I occasionally post notes to my <a
		    href="http://krisrs1128.github.io/info-uncertainty/">blog</a>. Most of
		    my projects are public on <a
		    href="http://github.com/krisrs1128">github</a>. </p>

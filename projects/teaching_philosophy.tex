\maketitle

Over the course of my PhD career, I've taught one and served as a teaching
assistant for six Statistics department courses. Further, I've volunteered to
teach in a few scientific and community workshops, and before my PhD, I taught
several SPLASH classes and was a staff tutor at the Stanford Center for Teaching
and Learning.

Through all this, I've had exposure to a wide range of teaching situations --
small (8 students) and large (> 140 students) classes, in person and remote,
undergraduates to PhDs, on and off campus. To adapt to these different
settings, I've found it helpful to be grounded by a few core principles,

\begin{itemize}
  \item Most technical concepts become clearer when explained visually and with
    concrete examples, and it helps to depart from textbook explanations in
    order to develop these perspectives.
  \item Historical context, or connections to fields outside of statistics, can
    be very motivating.
  \item It's impossible to be a good teacher without being an attentive
    listener.
  \item I believe anyone can develop mathematical and data analysis skill.
\end{itemize}

I think it's instructive to see how these values have manifested in the teaching
experience I mentioned at the outset.

I was the primary instructor for Stats 390 -- our department's statistical
consulting workshop -- during the summer of 2017. I volunteered after having
participated in the course as a consultant for 13 quarters (spanning both my
graduate and undergraduate careers). The class involved four open consulting
office hours a week, with 2 - 3 students advising researchers from across campus
on their analysis problems, and a weekly session for consultants only, where we
discussed problems from the prior week. I was lucky to have most of
infrastructural and evaluation issues fixed according to the department's
earlier iterations of the course. However, I did make a few modifications,
mainly due to the fact that I accepted more undergraduate students than is
typical. To make up for the fact that some students had less background in
statistics, I developed an ~ 40 page consulting ``cheat sheet'' describing
methods that can be used to resolve a wide range of the questions that appear
during our office hours. I spent half of each weekly session lecturing from
these notes, which are available on my webpage, feature summaries of real
consulting problems, and emphasize visual explanations. I alo dropped in on most
consulting sessions, which gave the students more opportunities to reach out and
get support, and which also allowed me to check-in with whether my lectures were
helping. My teaching evaluations are attached to this statement.

In terms of teaching assistantships, my favorite courses to organize have been
Stats 60 (Introductory Statistics), taught by Mike Baiocchi, and 315B (Data
Mining), taught by Jerry Friedman. I enjoyed them because (1) it was easy to
motivate course material with real-world problems, (2) many of the ideas that
students found confusing in lecture (like hypothesis testing and gradient
boosting) could be clarified during sections or office hours through drawings at
the whiteboard. My experience is that people find it easier to identify areas of
a text that are confusing once they attempt to build up geometric
representations of the key quantities.

Aside from departmental teaching, I have participated in a few community
workshops. In late August 2017, I was a TA for the 10-day workshop, ``Strategies
and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures'' (STAMPS), held at
the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. As a TA, I helped troubleshoot
code when students got lost during a workshop, and also helped prepare a few
special TA-arranged evening sessions. It was nice to spend so much time with
microbiome researchers from outside Stanford, and part of my commitment to
workflow-related papers comes from seeing them be useful to practitioners
outside of my immediate academic community.

I also volunteered for a weekend with Data Carpentery at Stanford, which gives
free data science courses to postdocs who would otherwise be unable to enroll in
courses. It was exciting to teach a class where students at once had little
technical background, but also knew the material from the course would be
immediately useful. I also learned some interesting tricks from the workshop,
like posting sticky-notes of different colors on each laptop, indicating whether
students whether students were running into technical or conceptual
difficulties. Separately, I was a core member of DataKind San Francisco, an
organization that promotes the use of data in the nonprofit sphere. We organized
a few DataDives (essentially hackathons, but without the competitive edge), and
it always required careful planning to ensure each project had tasks suited to
volunteers with potentially very different backgrounds. For example, we would
prepare data preparation and visualization tasks in different programming
languages, and defined roles for brainstorming discussion points and follow-up
ideas to share with our nonprofit collaborators.

Summarizing, I'm happy to have had opportunities to work in such diverse
teaching settings. I don't think there's anything that makes me more excited
than hearing (or sharing) a good idea from statistics, and that's certainly
helped me enjoy my work. Finally, in each of these settings, I've had to adapt
and grow as a teacher, and I expect my teaching style to evolve and improve as I
respond to what I find does and does not work in different teaching
environments.
